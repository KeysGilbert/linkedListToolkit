# linkedListToolkit
A collection of functions to create and manipulate a linked list in C++.
A linked list data structure is useful when you are frequently adding and removing elements.
When making your linked list, remember to first initialize the headPtr to NULL.
If headPtr == NULL, this means the list is empty
